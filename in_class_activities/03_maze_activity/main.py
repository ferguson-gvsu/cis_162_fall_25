from maze import *
start()
# DO NOT TOUCH THE LINES ABOVE!

# Solve the maze using these custom functions:
# move() -> Moves the mouse forward by one step
# move(N) -> Moves the mouse ahead by N steps, where N is an integer
# turn(direction) -> Turns 90 degrees. 
        # Direction should be "L" for left or "R" for right

# You are trying to reach the exit in the bottom right!
# The state of the maze will be printed after each function. 

# Example: spinning in a circle (feel free to remove)
turn("L")
turn("L")
turn("L")
turn("L")
